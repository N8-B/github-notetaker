#A Github Note Taker

This React app lets users to search by Github username, view the user's information and repos and add a note.

User bio, repos and note data are persisted in a Firebase database which is linked to the parent component's state.

ES2015 syntax is used in components and non-component JavaScript files.

Bootstrap is used for the styping simply because it was easy and because my focus was on React and React Router rather than styling.

To view, download or clone this repo, run `npm install` from within the root folder and then run `npm start`. This will start up the webpack server which will load the app at `http://localhost:8080`.
